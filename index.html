            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class="line"></div><br>
            <p>Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS (born 8 June 1955) is the inventor of the World Wide Web and he created a new computer language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which most web pages are written in. The first web page was available on 6 August 1991.

                Berners-Lee now leads the World Wide Web Consortium. That is an organization that looks after the World Wide Web. He is the author of the book Weaving the Web. He is a director of The Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In April 2009, he was elected as a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, based in Washington, D.C. In 1999, Time Magazine named Berners-Lee one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. In March 2000 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.</p><br>
                Tim Berners-Lee was born in London, on 8 June 1955. He is the son of Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods. First, he attended Sheen Mount primary school. Then he went on to Emanuel School in London, from 1969 to 1973. After that, he studied at Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976. While he was there, he received a first-class degree in Physics.<br>
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955, in London, England. His parents were mathematicians and worked on the first commercial computer at the University of Manchester. As a child, Berners-Lee was fascinated by computers. He also enjoyed mathematics and electronics. He attended the University of Oxford and graduated in 1976 with a degree in physics.</p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>Berners-Lee began his career as a computer software designer. He moved on to other positions in the computer industry. He worked at CERN, a physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. While at CERN, Berners-Lee worked on a system that would allow different computers to communicate with each other. In 1989 he wrote a proposal for a system that would allow researchers to share and retrieve techniques, practices, and results with each other at any time using the Internet. He created the software for the World Wide Web in 1990–91.

                    In 1994 Berners-Lee formed the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a professor. He also co-wrote Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor (1999).</p>
                    <h2>Awards and Honours</h2>
                    <p>Berners-Lee was elected a fellow in the Royal Society in 2001. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 and was awarded the Order of Merit in 2007. In 2004 Berners-Lee received the first Millennium Technology Prize, awarded by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation. He was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012.</p>
